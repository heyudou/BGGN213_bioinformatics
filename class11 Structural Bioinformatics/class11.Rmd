## 1.1 PDB statistics

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv",row.names=1)
stats
```
Q1: Determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. Also can you determine what proportion of structures are protein?
```{r}
pre.by.method <- round(stats$Total/sum(stats$Total)*100,2)
names(pre.by.method) <- rownames(stats)
pre.by.method
protein <- sum(stats$Proteins)/sum(stats$Total)*100
paste0("percent of the structures that are protein = ",round(protein,2),"%")
```

Q2: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
